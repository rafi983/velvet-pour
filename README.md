A stunning GSAP-powered cocktail website using React and Tailwind CSS—a modern, scroll-driven experience packed with advanced animations. Bring your design to life with dynamic SplitText reveals, smooth parallax scrolling, and scroll-triggered effects using GSAP’s ScrollTrigger. Lock sections in place with pinned animations, sync video playback to scroll position for cinematic storytelling, and enhance visual impact with scroll-based image masking. Create a custom animated carousel, craft seamless timeline animations across sections, and ensure a fully responsive UI that adapts beautifully across all screen sizes.
